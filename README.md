# CryptoTax

### _ReactJS application for calculating cryptocurrency taxes in Croatia._

# How it works?

Type down for how much HRK did you buy some crypto, also type down for how much you're selling it and for surtax reasons, type down you place of residence.

You should get 8 outputs, tax, surtax, expenses, and profit in HRK, USD, EUR, Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Depending on your place of the residence, surtax changes (example: Zagreb = 18%, Bjelovar = 12% etc.), so if you leave the field blank application will suppose that you dont have any surtaxes, also if your place of residence is not in the API.
